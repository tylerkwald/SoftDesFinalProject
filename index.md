## Tie-Ler? I barely Know Her...

This game was made by Tyler Ewald and Lucy Platt. Tie-ler? I barely know her. This game is an endless runner and the objective is to drive away from Babo with Tyler Ewald tied to the roof of your car. While you are running away from Babo there are Olin related obstacles that you have to dodge such as broken washers and smoking laptops. You are visualizing three different tracks and you can switch between them. Objects will spawn on each track and you will control the character to avoid the objects.
